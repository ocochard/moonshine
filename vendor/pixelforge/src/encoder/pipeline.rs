//! Asynchronous (push) encode pipelining, shared by all codecs.
//!
//! Each in-flight frame owns an [`EncodeSlot`] (its own input image, bitstream
//! buffer, encode command buffer, fence and query pool). [`EncodePipeline`]
//! rotates through the slots so that the CPU can record and submit frame N+1
//! while the GPU is still encoding frame N, instead of blocking on a fence after
//! every frame.
//!
//! Bitstream readback is performed off the calling thread: a single background
//! *completion thread* waits on each submission's fence, copies the bitstream
//! out, and resolves that frame's [`EncodeFuture`] the moment the GPU signals —
//! rather than deferring readback until the slot is reused. This delivers each
//! packet at roughly the GPU encode time instead of one or two `encode()` calls
//! later. Each `encode()` returns its own future (backed by a oneshot channel),
//! so packet delivery is paired with its submission by construction rather than
//! by a shared channel and a separate ordering convention.
//!
//! The DPB images and video session are shared across slots, so encode
//! submissions must still run in DPB order on the GPU. That ordering is enforced
//! with a single timeline semaphore (each submit waits on the previous submit's
//! value and signals its own). Only the calling thread ever touches the queue or
//! the timeline; the completion thread only waits on fences and reads bitstream
//! buffers, so the two never race on the same Vulkan object.
//!
//! Slot reuse is coordinated with a per-slot "busy" flag ([`SlotSync`]): a slot
//! is busy from submit until the completion thread has finished reading its
//! bitstream. The calling thread waits for the current slot to be free before
//! converting into / recording over it, which also covers the write-after-read
//! hazard on the shared input image.
